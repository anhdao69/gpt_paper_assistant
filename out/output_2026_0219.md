## 0. [SAM 3D Body: Robust Full-Body Human Mesh Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15989) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15989
**Authors:** Xitong Yang, Devansh Kukreja, Don Pinkus, Anushka Sagar, Taosha Fan, Jinhyung Park, Soyong Shin, Jinkun Cao, Jiawei Liu, Nicolas Ugrinovic, Matt Feiszli, Jitendra Malik, Piotr Dollar, Kris Kitani

**Abstract:**  We introduce SAM 3D Body (3DB), a promptable model for single-image full-body 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with strong generalization and consistent accuracy in diverse in-the-wild conditions. 3DB estimates the human pose of the body, feet, and hands. It is the first model to use a new parametric mesh representation, Momentum Human Rig (MHR), which decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. 3DB employs an encoder-decoder architecture and supports auxiliary prompts, including 2D keypoints and masks, enabling user-guided inference similar to the SAM family of models. We derive high-quality annotations from a multi-stage annotation pipeline that uses various combinations of manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection. Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions. We present a new evaluation dataset organized by pose and appearance categories, enabling nuanced analysis of model behavior. Our experiments demonstrate superior generalization and substantial improvements over prior methods in both qualitative user preference studies and traditional quantitative analysis. Both 3DB and MHR are open-source.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 4 as it introduces a new foundation model for 3D human mesh recovery with strong generalization and novel parametric mesh representation.

## 1. [MaS-VQA: A Mask-and-Select Framework for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15915) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15915
**Authors:** Xianwei Mao, Kai Ye, Sheng Zhou, Nan Zhang, Haikuan Huang, Bin Li, Jiajun Bu

**Abstract:**  Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) requires models to answer questions by integrating visual information with external knowledge. However, retrieved knowledge is often noisy, partially irrelevant, or misaligned with the visual content, while internal model knowledge is difficult to control and interpret. Naive aggregation of these sources limits reasoning effectiveness and reduces answer accuracy. To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it proposes a novel framework for knowledge-based visual question answering, integrating visual and external knowledge.

## 2. [OmniCT: Towards a Unified Slice-Volume LVLM for Comprehensive CT Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16110) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16110
**Authors:** Tianwei Lin, Zhongwei Qiu, Wenqiao Zhang, Jiang Liu, Yihan Xie, Mingjian Gao, Zhenxuan Fan, Zhaocheng Li, Sijing Li, Zhongle Xie, Peng LU, Yueting Zhuang, Yingda Xia, Ling Zhang, Beng Chin Ooi

**Abstract:**  Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used and diagnostically information-dense imaging modalities, covering critical organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and colon. Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models) and criterion 5 (Integration of Image/Video and Large Language Models) as it introduces a unified slice-volume LVLM for CT analysis with novel spatial and semantic enhancements.

## 3. [MedProbCLIP: Probabilistic Adaptation of Vision-Language Foundation Model for Reliable Radiograph-Report Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16019) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16019
**Authors:** Ahmad Elallaf, Yu Zhang, Yuktha Priya Masupalli, Jeong Yang, Young Lee, Zechun Cao, Gongbo Liang

**Abstract:**  Vision-language foundation models have emerged as powerful general-purpose representation learners with strong potential for multimodal understanding, but their deterministic embeddings often fail to provide the reliability required for high-stakes biomedical applications. This work introduces MedProbCLIP, a probabilistic vision-language learning framework for chest X-ray and radiology report representation learning and bidirectional retrieval. MedProbCLIP models image and text representations as Gaussian embeddings through a probabilistic contrastive objective that explicitly captures uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences between radiographs and clinical narratives. A variational information bottleneck mitigates overconfident predictions, while MedProbCLIP employs multi-view radiograph encoding and multi-section report encoding during training to provide fine-grained supervision for clinically aligned correspondence, yet requires only a single radiograph and a single report at inference. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, MedProbCLIP outperforms deterministic and probabilistic baselines, including CLIP, CXR-CLIP, and PCME++, in both retrieval and zero-shot classification. Beyond accuracy, MedProbCLIP demonstrates superior calibration, risk-coverage behavior, selective retrieval reliability, and robustness to clinically relevant corruptions, underscoring the value of probabilistic vision-language modeling for improving the trustworthiness and safety of radiology image-text retrieval systems.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 5 (Integration of Image/Video and Large Language Models) as it introduces a probabilistic vision-language framework for radiograph-report retrieval with novel probabilistic embeddings.

## 4. [HyPCA-Net: Advancing Multimodal Fusion in Medical Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16245) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16245
**Authors:** J. Dhar, M. K. Pandey, D. Chakladar, M. Haghighat, A. Alavi, S. Mistry, N. Zaidi

**Abstract:**  Multimodal fusion frameworks, which integrate diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT), have shown great potential in applications such as skin cancer detection, dementia diagnosis, and brain tumor prediction. However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

## 5. [Visual Memory Injection Attacks for Multi-Turn Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15927) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.15927
**Authors:** Christian Schlarmann, Matthias Hein

**Abstract:**  Generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance gains, and their user base is growing rapidly. However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks. We release the source code at https://github.com/chs20/visual-memory-injection

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 as it explores security vulnerabilities in generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) in multi-turn conversations.

## 6. [VETime: Vision Enhanced Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16681) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16681
**Authors:** Yingyuan Yang, Tian Lan, Yifei Gao, Yimeng Lu, Wenjun He, Meng Wang, Chenghao Liu, Chen Zhang

**Abstract:**  Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) requires identifying both immediate Point Anomalies and long-range Context Anomalies. However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches. Code available at: https://github.com/yyyangcoder/VETime.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 6 (Video Understanding) as it proposes a novel framework for time-series anomaly detection with a focus on visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion.

## 7. [Optimization Instability in Autonomous Agentic Workflows for Clinical Symptom Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16037) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16037
**Authors:** Cameron Cagan, Pedram Fard, Jiazi Tian, Jingya Cheng, Shawn N. Murphy, Hossein Estiri

**Abstract:**  Autonomous agentic workflows that iteratively refine their own behavior hold considerable promise, yet their failure modes remain poorly characterized. We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 3 (Embodied/Robotic AI: New Benchmarks or Methods) as it investigates optimization instability in autonomous agentic workflows and proposes methods to address failure modes.

## 8. [Improving Interactive In-Context Learning from Natural Language Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16066) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16066
**Authors:** Martin Klissarov, Jonathan Cook, Diego Antognini, Hao Sun, Jingling Li, Natasha Jaques, Claudiu Musat, Edward Grefenstette

**Abstract:**  Adapting one's thought process based on corrective feedback is an essential ability in human learning, particularly in collaborative settings. In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criterion but is generally relevant to interactive learning and feedback in large language models.

## 9. [Evidence-Grounded Subspecialty Reasoning: Evaluating a Curated Clinical Intelligence Layer on the 2025 Endocrinology Board-Style Examination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16050) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16050
**Authors:** Amir Hosseinian, MohammadReza Zare Shahneh, Umer Mansoor, Gilbert Szeto, Kirill Karlin, Nima Aghaeepour

**Abstract:**  Background: Large language models have demonstrated strong performance on general medical examinations, but subspecialty clinical reasoning remains challenging due to rapidly evolving guidelines and nuanced evidence hierarchies. Methods: We evaluated January Mirror, an evidence-grounded clinical reasoning system, against frontier LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Pro) on a 120-question endocrinology board-style examination. Mirror integrates a curated endocrinology and cardiometabolic evidence corpus with a structured reasoning architecture to generate evidence-linked outputs. Mirror operated under a closed-evidence constraint without external retrieval. Comparator LLMs had real-time web access to guidelines and primary literature. Results: Mirror achieved 87.5% accuracy (105/120; 95% CI: 80.4-92.3%), exceeding a human reference of 62.3% and frontier LLMs including GPT-5.2 (74.6%), GPT-5 (74.0%), and Gemini-3-Pro (69.8%). On the 30 most difficult questions (human accuracy less than 50%), Mirror achieved 76.7% accuracy. Top-2 accuracy was 92.5% for Mirror versus 85.25% for GPT-5.2. Conclusions: Mirror provided evidence traceability: 74.2% of outputs cited at least one guideline-tier source, with 100% citation accuracy on manual verification. Curated evidence with explicit provenance can outperform unconstrained web retrieval for subspecialty clinical reasoning and supports auditability for clinical deployment.

## 10. [Revolutionizing Long-Term Memory in AI: New Horizons with High-Capacity and High-Speed Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16192) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16192
**Authors:** Hiroaki Yamanaka, Daisuke Miyashita, Takashi Toi, Asuka Maki, Taiga Ikeda, Jun Deguchi

**Abstract:**  Driven by our mission of "uplifting the world with memory," this paper explores the design concept of "memory" that is essential for achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI). Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed "extract then store," involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the "store then on-demand extract" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.

## 11. [A Self-Supervised Approach for Enhanced Feature Representations in Object Detection Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16322) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16322
**Authors:** Santiago C. Vilabella, Pablo P\'erez-N\'u\~nez, Beatriz Remeseiro

**Abstract:**  In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence, where models are increasingly growing in complexity and size, the availability of labeled data for training deep learning models has become a significant challenge. Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.

## 12. [Towards a Science of AI Agent Reliability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16666) <a id="link12"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16666
**Authors:** Stephan Rabanser, Sayash Kapoor, Peter Kirgis, Kangheng Liu, Saiteja Utpala, Arvind Narayanan

**Abstract:**  AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criterion but is generally relevant to AI agent reliability and evaluation, which may interest your friend.

## 13. [Towards Efficient Constraint Handling in Neural Solvers for Routing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16012) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16012
**Authors:** Jieyi Bi, Zhiguang Cao, Jianan Zhou, Wen Song, Yaoxin Wu, Jie Zhang, Yining Ma, Cathy Wu

**Abstract:**  Neural solvers have achieved impressive progress in addressing simple routing problems, particularly excelling in computational efficiency. However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.

## 14. [Agent Skill Framework: Perspectives on the Potential of Small Language Models in Industrial Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16653) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.16653
**Authors:** Yangjie Xu, Lujun Li, Lama Sleem, Niccolo Gentile, Yewei Song, Yiqun Wang, Siming Ji, Wenbo Wu, Radu State

**Abstract:**  Agent Skill framework, now widely and officially supported by major players such as GitHub Copilot, LangChain, and OpenAI, performs especially well with proprietary models by improving context engineering, reducing hallucinations, and boosting task accuracy. Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criteria. Focuses on small language models and their application in industrial environments, which is tangential to the specified topics.
