## 0. [Do MLLMs Really Understand Space? A Mathematical Reasoning Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11635) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11635
**Authors:** Shuo Lu, Jianjie Cheng, Yinuo Xu, Yongcan Yu, Lijun Sheng, Peijie Wang, Siru Jiang, Yongguan Hu, Run Ling, Yihua Shao, Ao Ma, Wei Feng, Lingxiao He, Meng Wang, Qianlong Xie, Xingxing Wang, Ran He, Jian Liang

**Abstract:**  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

**Comment:** This paper closely matches criterion 1 (Spatial Intelligence and Embodied Agents) and criterion 2 (Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models) as it evaluates and improves spatial reasoning in MLLMs, which is a key aspect of spatial intelligence.

## 1. [Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11389) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11389
**Authors:** Heejeong Nam, Quentin Le Lidec, Lucas Maes, Yann LeCun, Randall Balestriero

**Abstract:**  World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions. Our code is available at https://github.com/galilai-group/cjepa.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 1 and 3 as it introduces an object-centric world model with latent interventions, relevant to spatial reasoning and embodied AI.

**Authors:** Onkar Susladkar, Tushar Prakash, Gayatri Deshmukh, Kiet A. Nguyen, Jiaxun Zhang, Adheesh Juvekar, Tianshu Bao, Lin Chai, Sparsh Mittal, Inderjit S Dhillon, Ismini Lourentzou

**Abstract:**  We propose UniDFlow, a unified discrete flow-matching framework for multimodal understanding, generation, and editing. It decouples understanding and generation via task-specific low-rank adapters, avoiding objective interference and representation entanglement, while a novel reference-based multimodal preference alignment optimizes relative outcomes under identical conditioning, improving faithfulness and controllability without large-scale retraining. UniDFlpw achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to tasks including inpainting, in-context image generation, reference-based editing, and compositional generation, despite no explicit task-specific training.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 5 as it proposes a unified framework for multimodal reasoning and generation, integrating vision and language tasks.

## 3. [DeepGen 1.0: A Lightweight Unified Multimodal Model for Advancing Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12205) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12205
**Authors:** Dianyi Wang, Ruihang Li, Feng Han, Chaofan Ma, Wei Song, Siyuan Wang, Yibin Wang, Yi Xin, Hongjian Liu, Zhixiong Zhang, Shengyuan Ding, Tianhang Wang, Zhenglin Cheng, Tao Lin, Cheng Jin, Kaicheng Yu, Jingjing Chen, Wenjie Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Jiaqi Wang

**Abstract:**  Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 5 as it explores a novel lightweight multimodal model for image generation and editing, integrating vision and language tasks.

## 4. [Active Zero: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models through Active Environment Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11241) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11241
**Authors:** Jinghan He, Junfeng Fang, Feng Xiong, Zijun Yao, Fei Shen, Haiyun Guo, Jinqiao Wang, Tat-Seng Chua

**Abstract:**  Self-play has enabled large language models to autonomously improve through self-generated challenges. However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines. These results highlight active exploration as a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models) due to its focus on self-evolving vision-language models and active exploration.

## 5. [Revis: Sparse Latent Steering to Mitigate Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11824) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11824
**Authors:** Jialin Wu, Wei Shi, Han Shen, Peigui Qi, Kunsheng Tang, Zhicong Huang, Binghao Wang, Zhou Yang

**Abstract:**  Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 as it addresses object hallucination in large vision-language models using a novel sparse latent steering approach.

## 6. [Beyond End-to-End Video Models: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Educational Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11790) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11790
**Authors:** Lingyong Yan, Jiulong Wu, Dong Xie, Weixian Shi, Deguo Xia, Jizhou Huang

**Abstract:**  Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

**Comment:** This paper matches criterion 5 (Integration of Image/Video and Large Language Models) as it proposes a system for generating educational videos by integrating LLMs with visual and audio components.

## 7. [ScalSelect: Scalable Training-Free Multimodal Data Selection for Efficient Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11636) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11636
**Authors:** Changti Wu, Jiahuai Mao, Yuzhuo Miao, Shijie Lian, Bin Yu, Xiaopeng Lin, Cong Huang, Lei Zhang, Kai Chen

**Abstract:**  Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/ChangtiWu/ScalSelect}{ScalSelect}.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 as it proposes a scalable data selection method for visual instruction tuning in vision-language models.

## 8. [Stress Tests REVEAL Fragile Temporal and Visual Grounding in Video-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11244) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11244
**Authors:** Sethuraman T V, Savya Khosla, Aditi Tiwari, Vidya Ganesh, Rakshana Jayaprakash, Aditya Jain, Vignesh Srinivasakumar, Onkar Kishor Susladkar, Srinidhi Sunkara, Aditya Shanmugham, Rakesh Vaideeswaran, Abbaas Alif Mohamed Nishar, Simon Jenni, Derek Hoiem

**Abstract:**  This work investigates a fundamental question: Do Video-Language Models (VidLMs) robustly account for video content, temporal sequence, and motion? Our investigation shows that, surprisingly, they often do not. We introduce REVEAL{}, a diagnostic benchmark that probes fundamental weaknesses of contemporary VidLMs through five controlled stress tests; assessing temporal expectation bias, reliance on language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and robustness to spatiotemporal occlusion. We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease. Alongside our benchmark, we provide a data pipeline that automatically generates diagnostic examples for our stress tests, enabling broader and more scalable evaluation. We will release our benchmark and code to support future research.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 6 as it introduces a diagnostic benchmark for video-language models, focusing on temporal and visual grounding.

## 9. [Adapting Vision-Language Models for E-commerce Understanding at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11733) <a id="link9"></a>

**Authors:** Matteo Nulli, Vladimir Orshulevich, Tala Bazazo, Christian Herold, Michael Kozielski, Marcin Mazur, Szymon Tuzel, Cees G. M. Snoek, Seyyed Hadi Hashemi, Omar Javed, Yannick Versley, Shahram Khadivi

**Abstract:**  E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

**Comment:** This paper matches criterion 2 (Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models) as it explores adapting vision-language models for e-commerce, which involves multimodal understanding and integration.

## 10. [Talk2DM: Enabling Natural Language Querying and Commonsense Reasoning for Vehicle-Road-Cloud Integrated Dynamic Maps with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11860) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11860
**Authors:** Lu Tao, Jinxuan Luo, Yousuke Watanabe, Zhengshu Zhou, Yuhuan Lu, Shen Ying, Pan Zhang, Fei Zhao, Hiroaki Takada

**Abstract:**  Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 1 (Spatial Intelligence and Embodied Agents) due to its focus on spatial querying and reasoning in vehicle-road-cloud systems.

## 11. [The Pensieve Paradigm: Stateful Language Models Mastering Their Own Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12108) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12108
**Authors:** Xiaoyuan Liu, Tian Liang, Dongyang Ma, Deyu Zhou, Haitao Mi, Pinjia He, Yan Wang

**Abstract:**  In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

**Comment:** This paper does not directly match any of the criteria but introduces a novel approach to state management in language models, which could be tangentially related to embodied agents (criterion 1) in terms of reasoning and memory management.

## 12. [Pushing Forward Pareto Frontiers of Proactive Agents with Behavioral Agentic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11351) <a id="link12"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11351
**Authors:** Yihang Yao, Zhepeng Cen, Haohong Lin, Shiqi Liu, Zuxin Liu, Jiacheng Zhu, Zhang-Wei Hong, Laixi Shi, Ding Zhao

**Abstract:**  Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

## 13. [HLA: Hadamard Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12128) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12128
**Authors:** Hanno Ackermann, Hong Cai, Mohsen Ghafoorian, Amirhossein Habibian

**Abstract:**  The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.   We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

**Comment:** Does not match any specific criteria but introduces a novel attention mechanism for video generation, which may be tangentially interesting.

## 14. [Latent Forcing: Reordering the Diffusion Trajectory for Pixel-Space Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11401) <a id="link14"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11401
**Authors:** Alan Baade, Eric Ryan Chan, Kyle Sargent, Changan Chen, Justin Johnson, Ehsan Adeli, Li Fei-Fei

**Abstract:**  Latent diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images but lose the benefits of end-to-end modeling. They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.

**Comment:** This paper does not match any specific criteria but is relevant to generative modeling in computer vision, which aligns with your friend's general interest area.

## 15. [ThinkRouter: Efficient Reasoning via Routing Thinking between Latent and Discrete Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11683) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11683
**Authors:** Xin Xu, Tong Yu, Xiang Chen, Haoliang Wang, Julian McAuley, Saayan Mitra

**Abstract:**  Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

## 16. [Beyond Parameter Arithmetic: Sparse Complementary Fusion for Distribution-Aware Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11717) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11717
**Authors:** Weihong Lin, Lin Sun, Qilong Shi, Aomufei Yuan, Yuxuan Tian, Zhengyang Wang, Guangxiang Zhao, Xiangzheng Zhang, Tong Yang

**Abstract:**  Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

## 17. [Pedagogically-Inspired Data Synthesis for Language Model Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12172) <a id="link17"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.12172
**Authors:** Bowei He, Yankai Chen, Xiaokun Zhang, Linghe Kong, Philip S. Yu, Xue Liu, Chen Ma

**Abstract:**  Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

## 18. [PLESS: Pseudo-Label Enhancement with Spreading Scribbles for Weakly Supervised Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11628) <a id="link18"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11628
**Authors:** Yeva Gabrielyan (Akian College of Science and Engineering, American University of Armenia, Yerevan, Armenia), Varduhi Yeghiazaryan (Akian College of Science and Engineering, American University of Armenia, Yerevan, Armenia), Irina Voiculescu (Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK)

**Abstract:**  Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.

## 19. [CausalAgent: A Conversational Multi-Agent System for End-to-End Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11527) <a id="link19"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.11527
**Authors:** Jiawei Zhu, Wei Chen, Ruichu Cai

**Abstract:**  Causal inference holds immense value in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.
