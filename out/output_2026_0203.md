## 0. [Any3D-VLA: Enhancing VLA Robustness via Diverse Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00807) <a id="link0"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00807
**Authors:** Xianzhe Fan, Shengliang Deng, Xiaoyang Wu, Yuxiang Lu, Zhuoling Li, Mi Yan, Yujia Zhang, Zhizheng Zhang, He Wang, Hengshuang Zhao

**Abstract:**  Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically take 2D images as visual input, which limits their spatial understanding in complex scenes. How can we incorporate 3D information to enhance VLA capabilities? We conduct a pilot study across different observation spaces and visual representations. The results show that explicitly lifting visual input into point clouds yields representations that better complement their corresponding 2D representations. To address the challenges of (1) scarce 3D data and (2) the domain gap induced by cross-environment differences and depth-scale biases, we propose Any3D-VLA. It unifies the simulator, sensor, and model-estimated point clouds within a training pipeline, constructs diverse inputs, and learns domain-agnostic 3D representations that are fused with the corresponding 2D representations. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate Any3D-VLA's advantages in improving performance and mitigating the domain gap. Our project homepage is available at https://xianzhefan.github.io/Any3D-VLA.github.io.

## 1. [Reasoning with Autoregressive-Diffusion Collaborative Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01608) <a id="link1"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01608
**Authors:** Mu Yuan, Liekang Zeng, Guoliang Xing, Lan Zhang, Yunhao Liu

**Abstract:**  Autoregressive and diffusion models represent two complementary generative paradigms. Autoregressive models excel at sequential planning and constraint composition, yet struggle with tasks that require explicit spatial or physical grounding. Diffusion models, in contrast, capture rich spatial structure through high-dimensional generation, but lack the stepwise logical control needed to satisfy complex, multi-stage constraints or to reliably identify and correct errors. We introduce Collaborative Thoughts, a unified collaborative framework that enables autoregressive and diffusion models to reason and generate jointly through a closed-loop interaction. In Collaborative Thoughts, autoregressive models perform structured planning and constraint management, diffusion models instantiate these constraints as intermediate visual thoughts, and a vision-based critic module evaluates whether the visual thoughts satisfy the intended structural and physical requirements. This feedback is then used to iteratively refine subsequent planning and generation steps, mitigating error propagation across modalities. Importantly, Collaborative Thoughts uses the same collaborative loop regardless of whether the task is autoregressive question answering or diffusion-based visual generation. Through representative examples, we illustrate how Collaborative Thoughts can improve the reliability of spatial reasoning and the controllability of generation.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 5 as it introduces a collaborative framework combining autoregressive and diffusion models for reasoning and generation, focusing on vision-language integration.

## 2. [Toward Cognitive Supersensing in Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01541) <a id="link2"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01541
**Authors:** Boyi Li, Yifan Shen, Yuanzhe Liu, Yifan Xu, Jiateng Liu, Xinzhuo Li, Zhengyuan Li, Jingyuan Zhu, Yunhan Zhong, Fangzhou Lan, Jianguo Cao, James M. Rehg, Heng Ji, Ismini Lourentzou, Xu Cao

**Abstract:**  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in open-vocabulary perceptual tasks, yet their ability to solve complex cognitive problems remains limited, especially when visual details are abstract and require visual memory. Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding. We will open-source the CogSense-Bench and our model weights.

## 3. [Learning Abstractions for Hierarchical Planning in Program-Synthesis Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00929) <a id="link3"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00929
**Authors:** Zergham Ahmed, Kazuki Irie, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Christopher J. Bates, Samuel J. Gershman

**Abstract:**  Humans learn abstractions and use them to plan efficiently to quickly generalize across tasks -- an ability that remains challenging for state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) agents and deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems. Inspired by the cognitive science of how people form abstractions and intuitive theories of their world knowledge, Theory-Based RL (TBRL) systems, such as TheoryCoder, exhibit strong generalization through effective use of abstractions. However, they heavily rely on human-provided abstractions and sidestep the abstraction-learning problem. We introduce TheoryCoder-2, a new TBRL agent that leverages LLMs' in-context learning ability to actively learn reusable abstractions rather than relying on hand-specified ones, by synthesizing abstractions from experience and integrating them into a hierarchical planning process. We conduct experiments on diverse environments, including BabyAI, Minihack and VGDL games like Sokoban. We find that TheoryCoder-2 is significantly more sample-efficient than baseline LLM agents augmented with classical planning domain construction, reasoning-based planning, and prior program-synthesis agents such as WorldCoder. TheoryCoder-2 is able to solve complex tasks that the baselines fail, while only requiring minimal human prompts, unlike prior TBRL systems.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 1 and 3 as it introduces a novel method for hierarchical planning in program-synthesis agents, focusing on spatial reasoning and embodied AI.

## 4. [Show, Don't Tell: Morphing Latent Reasoning into Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02227) <a id="link4"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.02227
**Authors:** Harold Haodong Chen, Xinxiang Yin, Wen-Jie Shu, Hongfei Zhang, Zixin Zhang, Chenfei Liao, Litao Guo, Qifeng Chen, Ying-Cong Chen

**Abstract:**  Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress, yet existing methods often lack the ability to dynamically reason and refine during generation--a hallmark of human creativity. Current reasoning-augmented paradigms most rely on explicit thought processes, where intermediate reasoning is decoded into discrete text at fixed steps with frequent image decoding and re-encoding, leading to inefficiencies, information loss, and cognitive mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce LatentMorph, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates implicit latent reasoning into the T2I generation process. At its core, LatentMorph introduces four lightweight components: (i) a condenser for summarizing intermediate generation states into compact visual memory, (ii) a translator for converting latent thoughts into actionable guidance, (iii) a shaper for dynamically steering next image token predictions, and (iv) an RL-trained invoker for adaptively determining when to invoke reasoning. By performing reasoning entirely in continuous latent spaces, LatentMorph avoids the bottlenecks of explicit reasoning and enables more adaptive self-refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentMorph (I) enhances the base model Janus-Pro by $16\%$ on GenEval and $25\%$ on T2I-CompBench; (II) outperforms explicit paradigms (e.g., TwiG) by $15\%$ and $11\%$ on abstract reasoning tasks like WISE and IPV-Txt, (III) while reducing inference time by $44\%$ and token consumption by $51\%$; and (IV) exhibits $71\%$ cognitive alignment with human intuition on reasoning invocation.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 2 and 5 as it explores a novel framework for integrating latent reasoning into text-to-image generation, which involves vision-language integration.

## 5. [From Pixels to Facts (Pix2Fact): Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning for Fine-Grained Visual Fact Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00593) <a id="link5"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00593
**Authors:** Yifan Jiang, Cong Zhang, Bofei Zhang, Yifan Yang, Bingzhang Wang, Yew-Soon Ong

**Abstract:**  Despite progress on general tasks, VLMs struggle with challenges demanding both detailed visual grounding and deliberate knowledge-based reasoning, a synergy not captured by existing benchmarks that evaluate these skills separately. To close this gap, we introduce Pix2Fact, a new visual question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate expert-level perception and knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning. Pix2Fact contains 1,000 high-resolution (4K+) images spanning 8 daily-life scenarios and situations, with questions and answers meticulously crafted by annotators holding PhDs from top global universities working in partnership with a professional data annotation firm. Each question requires detailed visual grounding, multi-hop reasoning, and the integration of external knowledge to answer. Our evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs, including proprietary models like Gemini-3-Pro and GPT-5, reveals the substantial challenge posed by Pix2Fact: the most advanced model achieves only 24.0% average accuracy, in stark contrast to human performance of 56%. This significant gap underscores the limitations of current models in replicating human-level visual comprehension. We believe Pix2Fact will serve as a critical benchmark to drive the development of next-generation multimodal agents that combine fine-grained perception with robust, knowledge-based reasoning.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models) as it introduces a benchmark for visual question answering requiring multi-hop reasoning and evaluates VLMs.

## 6. [JoyAvatar: Unlocking Highly Expressive Avatars via Harmonized Text-Audio Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00702) <a id="link6"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00702
**Authors:** Ruikui Wang, Jinheng Feng, Lang Tian, Huaishao Luo, Chaochao Li, Liangbo Zhou, Huan Zhang, Youzheng Wu, Xiaodong He

**Abstract:**  Existing video avatar models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in scenarios such as talking, public speaking, and singing. However, the majority of these methods exhibit limited alignment with respect to text instructions, particularly when the prompts involve complex elements including large full-body movement, dynamic camera trajectory, background transitions, or human-object interactions. To break out this limitation, we present JoyAvatar, a framework capable of generating long duration avatar videos, featuring two key technical innovations. Firstly, we introduce a twin-teacher enhanced training algorithm that enables the model to transfer inherent text-controllability from the foundation model while simultaneously learning audio-visual synchronization. Secondly, during training, we dynamically modulate the strength of multi-modal conditions (e.g., audio and text) based on the distinct denoising timestep, aiming to mitigate conflicts between the heterogeneous conditioning signals. These two key designs serve to substantially expand the avatar model's capacity to generate natural, temporally coherent full-body motions and dynamic camera movements as well as preserve the basic avatar capabilities, such as accurate lip-sync and identity consistency. GSB evaluation results demonstrate that our JoyAvatar model outperforms the state-of-the-art models such as Omnihuman-1.5 and KlingAvatar 2.0. Moreover, our approach enables complex applications including multi-person dialogues and non-human subjects role-playing. Some video samples are provided on https://joyavatar.github.io/.

## 7. [Residual Decoding: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via History-Aware Residual Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01047) <a id="link7"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01047
**Authors:** Xinrong Chen, Xu Chu, Yingmin Qiu, Hengyuan Zhang, Jing Xiong, Shiyu Tang, Shuai Liu, Shaokang Yang, Cheng Yang, Hayden Kwok-Hay So, Ngai Wong

**Abstract:**  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively from image-text inputs and perform well in various multimodal tasks. Despite this success, they are affected by language priors and often produce hallucinations. Hallucinations denote generated content that is grammatically and syntactically coherent, yet bears no match or direct relevance to actual visual input. To address this problem, we propose Residual Decoding (ResDec). It is a novel training-free method that uses historical information to aid decoding. The method relies on the internal implicit reasoning mechanism and token logits evolution mechanism of LVLMs to correct biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResDec effectively suppresses hallucinations induced by language priors, significantly improves visual grounding, and reduces object hallucinations. In addition to mitigating hallucinations, ResDec also performs exceptionally well on comprehensive LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its broad applicability.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 2 (Visual and Multimodal Large Language Models) as it addresses hallucination mitigation in large vision-language models.

## 8. [ReCALL: Recalibrating Capability Degradation for MLLM-based Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01639) <a id="link8"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01639
**Authors:** Tianyu Yang, ChenWei He, Xiangzhao Hao, Tianyue Wang, Jiarui Guo, Haiyun Guo, Leigang Qu, Jinqiao Wang, Tat-Seng Chua

**Abstract:**  Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images based on a hybrid query comprising a reference image and a modification text. Early dual-tower Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with cross-modality compositional reasoning required for this task. Recently, adapting generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for retrieval offers a promising direction. However, we identify that this adaptation strategy overlooks a fundamental issue: adapting a generative MLLM into a single-embedding discriminative retriever triggers a paradigm conflict, which leads to Capability Degradation - the deterioration of native fine-grained reasoning after retrieval adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose ReCALL (Recalibrating Capability Degradation), a model-agnostic framework that follows a diagnose-generate-refine pipeline: Firstly, we diagnose cognitive blind spots of the retriever via self-guided informative instance mining. Next, we generate corrective instructions and triplets by CoT prompting the foundation MLLM and conduct quality control with VQA-based consistency filtering. Finally, we refine the retriever through continual training on these triplets with a grouped contrastive scheme, thereby internalizing fine-grained visual-semantic distinctions and realigning the discriminative embedding space of retriever with intrinsic compositional reasoning within the MLLM. Extensive experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show that ReCALL consistently recalibrates degraded capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released soon.

## 9. [How Well Do Models Follow Visual Instructions? VIBE: A Systematic Benchmark for Visual Instruction-Driven Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01851) <a id="link9"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01851
**Authors:** Huanyu Zhang, Xuehai Bai, Chengzu Li, Chen Liang, Haochen Tian, Haodong Li, Ruichuan An, Yifan Zhang, Anna Korhonen, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan

**Abstract:**  Recent generative models have achieved remarkable progress in image editing. However, existing systems and benchmarks remain largely text-guided. In contrast, human communication is inherently multimodal, where visual instructions such as sketches efficiently convey spatial and structural intent. To address this gap, we introduce VIBE, the Visual Instruction Benchmark for Image Editing with a three-level interaction hierarchy that captures deictic grounding, morphological manipulation, and causal reasoning. Across these levels, we curate high-quality and diverse test cases that reflect progressively increasing complexity in visual instruction following. We further propose a robust LMM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with task-specific metrics to enable scalable and fine-grained assessment. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 17 representative open-source and proprietary image editing models, we find that proprietary models exhibit early-stage visual instruction-following capabilities and consistently outperform open-source models. However, performance degrades markedly with increasing task difficulty even for the strongest systems, highlighting promising directions for future research.

**Comment:** Matches criteria 7 as it introduces a systematic benchmark for visual instruction-driven image editing, providing insights into the state of the art.

## 10. [GLAD: Generative Language-Assisted Visual Tracking for Low-Semantic Templates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00570) <a id="link10"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00570
**Authors:** Xingyu Luo, Yidong Cai, Jie Liu, Jie Tang, Gangshan Wu, Limin Wang

**Abstract:**  Vision-language tracking has gained increasing attention in many scenarios. This task simultaneously deals with visual and linguistic information to localize objects in videos. Despite its growing utility, the development of vision-language tracking methods remains in its early stage. Current vision-language trackers usually employ Transformer architectures for interactive integration of template, search, and text features. However, persistent challenges about low-semantic images including prevalent image blurriness, low resolution and so on, may compromise model performance through degraded cross-modal understanding. To solve this problem, language assistance is usually used to deal with the obstacles posed by low-semantic images. However, due to the existing gap between current textual and visual features, direct concatenation and fusion of these features may have limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce a pioneering Generative Language-AssisteD tracking model, GLAD, which utilizes diffusion models for the generative multi-modal fusion of text description and template image to bolster compatibility between language and image and enhance template image semantic information. Our approach demonstrates notable improvements over the existing fusion paradigms. Blurry and semantically ambiguous template images can be restored to improve multi-modal features in the generative fusion paradigm. Experiments show that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks and achieves an impressive inference speed. The code and models will be released at: https://github.com/Confetti-lxy/GLAD

## 11. [Learning Sparse Visual Representations via Spatial-Semantic Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01905) <a id="link11"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01905
**Authors:** Theodore Zhengde Zhao, Sid Kiblawi, Jianwei Yang, Naoto Usuyama, Reuben Tan, Noel C Codella, Tristan Naumann, Hoifung Poon, Mu Wei

**Abstract:**  Self-supervised learning (SSL) faces a fundamental conflict between semantic understanding and image reconstruction. High-level semantic SSL (e.g., DINO) relies on global tokens that are forced to be location-invariant for augmentation alignment, a process that inherently discards the spatial coordinates required for reconstruction. Conversely, generative SSL (e.g., MAE) preserves dense feature grids for reconstruction but fails to produce high-level abstractions. We introduce STELLAR, a framework that resolves this tension by factorizing visual features into a low-rank product of semantic concepts and their spatial distributions. This disentanglement allows us to perform DINO-style augmentation alignment on the semantic tokens while maintaining the precise spatial mapping in the localization matrix necessary for pixel-level reconstruction. We demonstrate that as few as 16 sparse tokens under this factorized form are sufficient to simultaneously support high-quality reconstruction (2.60 FID) and match the semantic performance of dense backbones (79.10% ImageNet accuracy). Our results highlight STELLAR as a versatile sparse representation that bridges the gap between discriminative and generative vision by strategically separating semantic identity from spatial geometry.

## 12. [Causal Forcing: Autoregressive Diffusion Distillation Done Right for High-Quality Real-Time Interactive Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02214) <a id="link12"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.02214
**Authors:** Hongzhou Zhu, Min Zhao, Guande He, Hang Su, Chongxuan Li, Jun Zhu

**Abstract:**  To achieve real-time interactive video generation, current methods distill pretrained bidirectional video diffusion models into few-step autoregressive (AR) models, facing an architectural gap when full attention is replaced by causal attention. However, existing approaches do not bridge this gap theoretically. They initialize the AR student via ODE distillation, which requires frame-level injectivity, where each noisy frame must map to a unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of an AR teacher. Distilling an AR student from a bidirectional teacher violates this condition, preventing recovery of the teacher's flow map and instead inducing a conditional-expectation solution, which degrades performance. To address this issue, we propose Causal Forcing that uses an AR teacher for ODE initialization, thereby bridging the architectural gap. Empirical results show that our method outperforms all baselines across all metrics, surpassing the SOTA Self Forcing by 19.3\% in Dynamic Degree, 8.7\% in VisionReward, and 16.7\% in Instruction Following.

## 13. [Beyond Open Vocabulary: Multimodal Prompting for Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01954) <a id="link13"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01954
**Authors:** Shuai Yang, Ziyue Huang, Jiaxin Chen, Qingjie Liu, Yunhong Wang

**Abstract:**  Open-vocabulary object detection in remote sensing commonly relies on text-only prompting to specify target categories, implicitly assuming that inference-time category queries can be reliably grounded through pretraining-induced text-visual alignment. In practice, this assumption often breaks down in remote sensing scenarios due to task- and application-specific category semantics, resulting in unstable category specification under open-vocabulary settings. To address this limitation, we propose RS-MPOD, a multimodal open-vocabulary detection framework that reformulates category specification beyond text-only prompting by incorporating instance-grounded visual prompts, textual prompts, and their multimodal integration. RS-MPOD introduces a visual prompt encoder to extract appearance-based category cues from exemplar instances, enabling text-free category specification, and a multimodal fusion module to integrate visual and textual information when both modalities are available. Extensive experiments on standard, cross-dataset, and fine-grained remote sensing benchmarks show that visual prompting yields more reliable category specification under semantic ambiguity and distribution shifts, while multimodal prompting provides a flexible alternative that remains competitive when textual semantics are well aligned.

**Comment:** Matches criterion 5 (Integration of Image/Video and Large Language Models) as it explores multimodal prompting for object detection in remote sensing.

**Abstract:**  Recent advances in autonomous LLM agents demonstrate their ability to improve performance through iterative interaction with the environment. We define this paradigm as Test-Time Improvement (TTI). However, the mechanisms under how and why TTI succeed or fail remain poorly understood, and existing evaluation metrics fail to capture their task optimization efficiency, behavior adaptation after erroneous actions, and the specific utility of working memory for task completion. To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment.

## 15. [S$^3$POT: Contrast-Driven Face Occlusion Segmentation via Self-Supervised Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00635) <a id="link15"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00635
**Authors:** Lingsong Wang, Mancheng Meng, Ziyan Wu, Terrence Chen, Fan Yang, Dinggang Shen

**Abstract:**  Existing face parsing methods usually misclassify occlusions as facial components. This is because occlusion is a high-level concept, it does not refer to a concrete category of object. Thus, constructing a real-world face dataset covering all categories of occlusion object is almost impossible and accurate mask annotation is labor-intensive. To deal with the problems, we present S$^3$POT, a contrast-driven framework synergizing face generation with self-supervised spatial prompting, to achieve occlusion segmentation. The framework is inspired by the insights: 1) Modern face generators' ability to realistically reconstruct occluded regions, creating an image that preserve facial geometry while eliminating occlusion, and 2) Foundation segmentation models' (e.g., SAM) capacity to extract precise mask when provided with appropriate prompts. In particular, S$^3$POT consists of three modules: Reference Generation (RF), Feature enhancement (FE), and Prompt Selection (PS). First, a reference image is produced by RF using structural guidance from parsed mask. Second, FE performs contrast of tokens between raw and reference images to obtain an initial prompt, then modifies image features with the prompt by cross-attention. Third, based on the enhanced features, PS constructs a set of positive and negative prompts and screens them with a self-attention network for a mask decoder. The network is learned under the guidance of three novel and complementary objective functions without occlusion ground truth mask involved. Extensive experiments on a dedicatedly collected dataset demonstrate S$^3$POT's superior performance and the effectiveness of each module.

**Comment:** This paper aligns with criterion 4 as it focuses on a novel framework for occlusion segmentation using foundation models and self-supervised learning, which is relevant to vision foundation models and their applications.

## 16. [RE-MCDF: Closed-Loop Multi-Expert LLM Reasoning for Knowledge-Grounded Clinical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01297) <a id="link16"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01297
**Authors:** Shaowei Shen, Xiaohong Yang, Jie Yang, Lianfen Huang, Yongcai Zhang, Yang Zou, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour

**Abstract:**  Electronic medical records (EMRs), particularly in neurology, are inherently heterogeneous, sparse, and noisy, which poses significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) in clinical diagnosis. In such settings, single-agent systems are vulnerable to self-reinforcing errors, as their predictions lack independent validation and can drift toward spurious conclusions. Although recent multi-agent frameworks attempt to mitigate this issue through collaborative reasoning, their interactions are often shallow and loosely structured, failing to reflect the rigorous, evidence-driven processes used by clinical experts. More fundamentally, existing approaches largely ignore the rich logical dependencies among diseases, such as mutual exclusivity, pathological compatibility, and diagnostic confusion. This limitation prevents them from ruling out clinically implausible hypotheses, even when sufficient evidence is available. To overcome these, we propose RE-MCDF, a relation-enhanced multi-expert clinical diagnosis framework. RE-MCDF introduces a generation--verification--revision closed-loop architecture that integrates three complementary components: (i) a primary expert that generates candidate diagnoses and supporting evidence, (ii) a laboratory expert that dynamically prioritizes heterogeneous clinical indicators, and (iii) a multi-relation awareness and evaluation expert group that explicitly enforces inter-disease logical constraints. Guided by a medical knowledge graph (MKG), the first two experts adaptively reweight EMR evidence, while the expert group validates and corrects candidate diagnoses to ensure logical consistency. Extensive experiments on the neurology subset of CMEMR (NEEMRs) and on our curated dataset (XMEMRs) demonstrate that RE-MCDF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in complex diagnostic scenarios.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00265
**Authors:** Dong Liang, Yuhao Liu, Jinyuan Jia, Youjun Zhao, Rynson W. H. Lau

**Abstract:**  Being able to edit panoramic images is crucial for creating realistic 360{\deg} visual experiences. However, existing perspective-based image editing methods fail to model the spatial structure of panoramas. Conventional cube-map decompositions attempt to overcome this problem but inevitably break global consistency due to their mismatch with spherical geometry. Motivated by this insight, we reformulate panoramic editing directly in the equirectangular projection (ERP) domain and present World-Shaper, a unified geometry-aware framework that bridges panoramic generation and editing within a single editing-centric design. To overcome the scarcity of paired data, we adopt a generate-then-edit paradigm, where controllable panoramic generation serves as an auxiliary stage to synthesize diverse paired examples for supervised editing learning. To address geometric distortion, we introduce a geometry-aware learning strategy that explicitly enforces position-aware shape supervision and implicitly internalizes panoramic priors through progressive training. Extensive experiments on our new benchmark, PEBench, demonstrate that our method achieves superior geometric consistency, editing fidelity, and text controllability compared to SOTA methods, enabling coherent and flexible 360{\deg} visual world creation with unified editing control. Code, model, and data will be released at our project page: https://world-shaper-project.github.io/

## 18. [DSFC-Net: A Dual-Encoder Spatial and Frequency Co-Awareness Network for Rural Road Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01278) <a id="link18"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01278
**Authors:** Zhengbo Zhang, Yihe Tian, Wanke Xia, Lin Chen, Yue Sun, Kun Ding, Ying Wang, Bing Xu, Shiming Xiang

**Abstract:**  Accurate extraction of rural roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is essential for infrastructure planning and sustainable development. However, this task presents unique challenges in rural settings due to several factors. These include high intra-class variability and low inter-class separability from diverse surface materials, frequent vegetation occlusions that disrupt spatial continuity, and narrow road widths that exacerbate detection difficulties. Existing methods, primarily optimized for structured urban environments, often underperform in these scenarios as they overlook such distinctive characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose DSFC-Net, a dual-encoder framework that synergistically fuses spatial and frequency-domain information. Specifically, a CNN branch is employed to capture fine-grained local road boundaries and short-range continuity, while a novel Spatial-Frequency Hybrid Transformer (SFT) is introduced to robustly model global topological dependencies against vegetation occlusions. Distinct from standard attention mechanisms that suffer from frequency bias, the SFT incorporates a Cross-Frequency Interaction Attention (CFIA) module that explicitly decouples high- and low-frequency information via a Laplacian Pyramid strategy. This design enables the dynamic interaction between spatial details and frequency-aware global contexts, effectively preserving the connectivity of narrow roads. Furthermore, a Channel Feature Fusion Module (CFFM) is proposed to bridge the two branches by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise feature responses, seamlessly integrating local textures with global semantics for accurate segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on the WHU-RuR+, DeepGlobe, and Massachusetts datasets validate the superiority of DSFC-Net over state-of-the-art approaches.

## 19. [Trust but Verify: Adaptive Conditioning for Reference-Based Diffusion Super-Resolution via Implicit Reference Correlation Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01864) <a id="link19"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01864
**Authors:** Yuan Wang, Yuhao Wan, Siming Zheng, Bo Li, Qibin Hou, Peng-Tao Jiang

**Abstract:**  Recent works have explored reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) to mitigate hallucinations in diffusion-based image restoration. A key challenge is that real-world degradations make correspondences between low-quality (LQ) inputs and reference (Ref) images unreliable, requiring adaptive control of reference usage. Existing methods either ignore LQ-Ref correlations or rely on brittle explicit matching, leading to over-reliance on misleading references or under-utilization of valuable cues. To address this, we propose Ada-RefSR, a single-step diffusion framework guided by a "Trust but Verify" principle: reference information is leveraged when reliable and suppressed otherwise. Its core component, Adaptive Implicit Correlation Gating (AICG), employs learnable summary tokens to distill dominant reference patterns and capture implicit correlations with LQ features. Integrated into the attention backbone, AICG provides lightweight, adaptive regulation of reference guidance, serving as a built-in safeguard against erroneous fusion. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that Ada-RefSR achieves a strong balance of fidelity, naturalness, and efficiency, while remaining robust under varying reference alignment.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00815
**Authors:** Yunjian Zhang, Sudong Wang, Yang Li, Peiran Xu, Conghao Zhou, Xiaoyue Ma, Jianing Li, Yao Zhu

**Abstract:**  Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, with reinforcement learning under verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a principled framework for aligning model behavior with reasoning chains. Despite its promise, RLVR remains prohibitively resource-intensive, requiring extensive reward signals and incurring substantial rollout costs during training. In this work, we revisit the fundamental question of data and compute efficiency in RLVR. We first establish a theoretical lower bound on the sample complexity required to unlock reasoning capabilities, and empirically validate that strong performance can be achieved with a surprisingly small number of training instances. To tackle the computational burden, we propose Dynamic One-Shot Policy Refinement (DoPR), an uncertainty-aware RL strategy that dynamically selects a single informative training sample per batch for policy updates, guided by reward volatility and exploration-driven acquisition. DoPR reduces rollout overhead by nearly an order of magnitude while preserving competitive reasoning accuracy, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for LLM post-training. This approach offers a practical path toward more efficient and accessible RL-based training for reasoning-intensive LLM applications.

**Authors:** Yu Wang, Chuanguang Yang, Zhulin An, Weilun Feng, Jiarui Zhao, Chengqing Yu, Libo Huang, Boyu Diao, Yongjun Xu

**Abstract:**  Existing Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods often align feature information between teacher and student by exploring meaningful feature processing and loss functions. However, due to the difference in feature distributions between the teacher and student, the student model may learn incompatible information from the teacher. To address this problem, we propose teacher-guided student Diffusion Self-KD, dubbed as DSKD. Instead of the direct teacher-student alignment, we leverage the teacher classifier to guide the sampling process of denoising student features through a light-weight diffusion model. We then propose a novel locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-guided feature distillation method between the original and denoised student features. The denoised student features encapsulate teacher knowledge and could be regarded as a teacher role. In this way, our DSKD method could eliminate discrepancies in mapping manners and feature distributions between the teacher and student, while learning meaningful knowledge from the teacher. Experiments on visual recognition tasks demonstrate that DSKD significantly outperforms existing KD methods across various models and datasets. Our code is attached in supplementary material.

## 22. [Eliminating Registration Bias in Synthetic CT Generation: A Physics-Based Simulation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02130) <a id="link22"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.02130
**Authors:** Lukas Zimmermann, Michael Rauter, Maximilian Schmid, Dietmar Georg, Barbara Kn\"ausl

**Abstract:**  Supervised synthetic CT generation from CBCT requires registered training pairs, yet perfect registration between separately acquired scans remains unattainable. This registration bias propagates into trained models and corrupts standard evaluation metrics. This may suggest that superior benchmark performance indicates better reproduction of registration artifacts rather than anatomical fidelity. We propose physics-based CBCT simulation to provide geometrically aligned training pairs by construction, combined with evaluation using geometric alignment metrics against input CBCT rather than biased ground truth. On two independent pelvic datasets, models trained on synthetic data achieved superior geometric alignment (Normalized Mutual Information: 0.31 vs 0.22) despite lower conventional intensity scores. Intensity metrics showed inverted correlations with clinical assessment for deformably registered data, while Normalized Mutual Information consistently predicted observer preference across registration methodologies (rho = 0.31, p < 0.001). Clinical observers preferred synthetic-trained outputs in 87% of cases, demonstrating that geometric fidelity, not intensity agreement with biased ground truth, aligns with clinical requirements.

## 23. [Mitigating Safety Tax via Distribution-Grounded Refinement in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02136) <a id="link23"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.02136
**Authors:** Yingsha Xie, Tiansheng Huang, Enneng Yang, Rui Min, Wenjie Lu, Xiaochun Cao, Naiqiang Tan, Li Shen

**Abstract:**  Safety alignment incurs safety tax that perturbs a large reasoning model's (LRM) general reasoning ability. Existing datasets used for safety alignment for an LRM are usually constructed by distilling safety reasoning traces and answers from an external LRM or human labeler. However, such reasoning traces and answers exhibit a distributional gap with the target LRM that needs alignment, and we conjecture such distributional gap is the culprit leading to significant degradation of reasoning ability of the target LRM. Driven by this hypothesis, we propose a safety alignment dataset construction method, dubbed DGR. DGR transforms and refines an existing out-of-distributional safety reasoning dataset to be aligned with the target's LLM inner distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that i) DGR effectively mitigates the safety tax while maintaining safety performance across all baselines, i.e., achieving \textbf{+30.2\%} on DirectRefusal and \textbf{+21.2\%} on R1-ACT improvement in average reasoning accuracy compared to Vanilla SFT; ii) the degree of reasoning degradation correlates with the extent of distribution shift, suggesting that bridging this gap is central to preserving capabilities. Furthermore, we find that safety alignment in LRMs may primarily function as a mechanism to activate latent knowledge, as a mere \textbf{10} samples are sufficient for activating effective refusal behaviors. These findings not only emphasize the importance of distributional consistency but also provide insights into the activation mechanism of safety in reasoning models.

## 24. [Self-Guard: Defending Large Reasoning Models via enhanced self-reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00707) <a id="link24"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00707
**Authors:** Jingnan Zheng, Jingjun Xu, Yanzhen Luo, Chenhang Cui, Gelei Deng, Zhenkai Liang, Xiang Wang, An Zhang, Tat-Seng Chua

**Abstract:**  The emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduces a new paradigm of explicit reasoning, enabling remarkable advances yet posing unique risks such as reasoning manipulation and information leakage. To mitigate these risks, current alignment strategies predominantly rely on heavy post-training paradigms or external interventions. However, these approaches are often computationally intensive and fail to address the inherent awareness-compliance gap, a critical misalignment where models recognize potential risks yet prioritize following user instructions due to their sycophantic tendencies. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Guard, a lightweight safety defense framework that reinforces safety compliance at the representational level. Self-Guard operates through two principal stages: (1) safety-oriented prompting, which activates the model's latent safety awareness to evoke spontaneous reflection, and (2) safety activation steering, which extracts the resulting directional shift in the hidden state space and amplifies it to ensure that safety compliance prevails over sycophancy during inference. Experiments demonstrate that Self-Guard effectively bridges the awareness-compliance gap, achieving robust safety performance without compromising model utility. Furthermore, Self-Guard exhibits strong generalization across diverse unseen risks and varying model scales, offering a cost-efficient solution for LRM safety alignment.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00470
**Authors:** Pengyu Chen, Fangzheng Lyu, Sicheng Wang, Cuizhen Wang

**Abstract:**  Individual tree crown segmentation is an important task in remote sensing for forest biomass estimation and ecological monitoring. However, accurate delineation in dense, overlapping canopies remains a bottleneck. While supervised deep learning methods suffer from high annotation costs and limited generalization, emerging foundation models (e.g., Segment Anything Model) often lack domain knowledge, leading to under-segmentation in dense clusters. To bridge this gap, we propose ZS-TreeSeg, a Zero-Shot framework that adapts from two mature tasks: 1) Canopy Semantic segmentation; and 2) Cells instance segmentation. By modeling tree crowns as star-convex objects within a topological flow field using Cellpose-SAM, the ZS-TreeSeg framework forces the mathematical separation of touching tree crown instances based on vector convergence. Experiments on the NEON and BAMFOREST datasets and visual inspection demonstrate that our framework generalizes robustly across diverse sensor types and canopy densities, which can offer a training-free solution for tree crown instance segmentation and labels generation.

## 26. [Opportunistic Promptable Segmentation: Leveraging Routine Radiological Annotations to Guide 3D CT Lesion Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00309) <a id="link26"></a>
**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00309
**Authors:** Samuel Church, Joshua D. Warner, Danyal Maqbool, Xin Tie, Junjie Hu, Meghan G. Lubner, Tyler J. Bradshaw

**Abstract:**  The development of machine learning models for CT imaging depends on the availability of large, high-quality, and diverse annotated datasets. Although large volumes of CT images and reports are readily available in clinical picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), 3D segmentations of critical findings are costly to obtain, typically requiring extensive manual annotation by radiologists. On the other hand, it is common for radiologists to provide limited annotations of findings during routine reads, such as line measurements and arrows, that are often stored in PACS as GSPS objects. We posit that these sparse annotations can be extracted along with CT volumes and converted into 3D segmentations using promptable segmentation models, a paradigm we term Opportunistic Promptable Segmentation. To enable this paradigm, we propose SAM2CT, the first promptable segmentation model designed to convert radiologist annotations into 3D segmentations in CT volumes. SAM2CT builds upon SAM2 by extending the prompt encoder to support arrow and line inputs and by introducing Memory-Conditioned Memories (MCM), a memory encoding strategy tailored to 3D medical volumes. On public lesion segmentation benchmarks, SAM2CT outperforms existing promptable segmentation models and similarly trained baselines, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of 0.649 for arrow prompts and 0.757 for line prompts. Applying the model to pre-existing GSPS annotations from a clinical PACS (N = 60), SAM2CT generates 3D segmentations that are clinically acceptable or require only minor adjustments in 87% of cases, as scored by radiologists. Additionally, SAM2CT demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on select Emergency Department findings. These results suggest that large-scale mining of historical GSPS annotations represents a promising and scalable approach for generating 3D CT segmentation datasets.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.00395
**Authors:** Roger Hsiao, Yuchen Fang, Xiangru Huang, Ruilong Li, Hesam Rabeti, Zan Gojcic, Javad Lavaei, James Demmel, Sophia Shao

**Abstract:**  We propose 3DGS$^2$-TR,a second-order optimizer for accelerating the scene training problem in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing second-order approaches that rely on explicit or dense curvature representations, such as 3DGS-LM (H\"ollein et al., 2025) or 3DGS2 (Lan et al., 2025), our method approximates curvature using only the diagonal of the Hessian matrix, efficiently via Hutchinson's method. Our approach is fully matrix-free and has the same complexity as ADAM (Kingma, 2024), $O(n)$ in both computation and memory costs. To ensure stable optimization in the presence of strong nonlinearity in the 3DGS rasterization process, we introduce a parameter-wise trust-region technique based on the squared Hellinger distance, regularizing updates to Gaussian parameters. Under identical parameter initialization and without densification, 3DGS$^2$-TR is able to achieve better reconstruction quality on standard datasets, using 50% fewer training iterations compared to ADAM, while incurring less than 1GB of peak GPU memory overhead (17% more than ADAM and 85% less than 3DGS-LM), enabling scalability to very large scenes and potentially to distributed training settings.

**ArXiv ID:** 2602.01283
**Authors:** Xianhui Zhang, Chengyu Xie, Linxia Zhu, Yonghui Yang, Weixiang Zhao, Zifeng Cheng, Cong Wang, Fei Shen, Tat-Seng Chua

**Abstract:**  Multilingual safety remains significantly imbalanced, leaving non-high-resource (NHR) languages vulnerable compared to robust high-resource (HR) ones. Moreover, the neural mechanisms driving safety alignment remain unclear despite observed cross-lingual representation transfer.   In this paper, we find that LLMs contain a set of cross-lingual shared safety neurons (SS-Neurons), a remarkably small yet critical neuronal subset that jointly regulates safety behavior across languages.   We first identify monolingual safety neurons (MS-Neurons) and validate their causal role in safety refusal behavior through targeted activation and suppression.   Our cross-lingual analyses then identify SS-Neurons as the subset of MS-Neurons shared between HR and NHR languages, serving as a bridge to transfer safety capabilities from HR to NHR domains.   We observe that suppressing these neurons causes concurrent safety drops across NHR languages, whereas reinforcing them improves cross-lingual defensive consistency.   Building on these insights, we propose a simple neuron-oriented training strategy that targets SS-Neurons based on language resource distribution and model architecture. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning this tiny neuronal subset outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing NHR safety while maintaining the model's general capabilities.   The code and dataset will be available athttps://github.com/1518630367/SS-Neuron-Expansion.

**Abstract:**  Hyperkinetic movement disorders (HMDs) such as dystonia, tremor, chorea, myoclonus, and tics are disabling motor manifestations across childhood and adulthood. Their fluctuating, intermittent, and frequently co-occurring expressions hinder clinical recognition and longitudinal monitoring, which remain largely subjective and vulnerable to inter-rater variability. Objective and scalable methods to distinguish overlapping HMD phenotypes from routine clinical videos are still lacking. Here, we developed a pose-based machine-learning framework that converts standard outpatient videos into anatomically meaningful keypoint time series and computes kinematic descriptors spanning statistical, temporal, spectral, and higher-order irregularity-complexity features.

**Comment:** This paper does not directly match any of the specific criteria but is related to machine learning applications in pose estimation and movement analysis, which might be of general interest.
